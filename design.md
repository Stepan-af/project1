*(Journey Focus – Mobile App UI)*

---

Design a **mobile app UI** for an MVP application called **Journey Focus**.

### App concept

Journey Focus is a **focus timer app** that uses the metaphor of a journey (train / car / ferry).
This is **NOT a navigation app** and **NOT a maps app**.

Users:

* select a journey
* start a fixed-time focus session
* see progress as movement along a route
* finish with an “arrival” screen and simple statistics

---

### Target platforms

* iOS and Android
* Mobile-first design
* Single-column layouts

---

### Design goals

* Calm
* Minimal
* Focus-oriented
* Slightly “travel-inspired”, but subtle
* No gamification overload

Avoid:

* flashy gradients
* neon colors
* heavy illustrations
* map-like UI complexity

---

### Visual style

* Clean, modern, minimalist
* Soft neutral background (light mode)
* Accent colors inspired by travel:

  * deep blue
  * muted green
  * warm gray
* Rounded cards
* Smooth transitions
* Clear typography

---

### Core screens to design

#### 1. Routes List Screen

* List of journey cards
* Each card shows:

  * route title (e.g. “London → Paris”)
  * transport type icon (train / car / ferry)
  * duration (e.g. “45 min”)
* Filter chips by transport type
* Simple search bar

---

#### 2. Route Details Screen

* Map preview (static-looking, not interactive-heavy)
* Route polyline
* Start and end markers
* Route title
* Short description
* Prominent **“Start Journey”** button

---

#### 3. Session Screen (Focus Mode)

* Large countdown timer
* Minimal progress bar
* Subtle animated marker moving along route
* Pause / Resume button
* Calm, distraction-free layout

This screen should feel:

* quiet
* focused
* immersive

---

#### 4. Arrival Screen

* “You have arrived” message
* Route title
* Session duration
* Current streak (days)
* Primary button: Share
* Secondary button: Back to routes

---

#### 5. Statistics Screen

* Simple metrics:

  * Today
  * Last 7 days
  * All time
* Total focus time
* Session count
* Current streak
* Optional simple bar chart

---

### UX principles

* Very few actions per screen
* Clear primary action
* Predictable navigation
* No hidden gestures
* No unnecessary animations

---

### Deliverables

* High-fidelity mobile UI
* Consistent components
* Reusable design system elements:

  * buttons
  * cards
  * icons
  * typography styles

---

### Tone

This app should feel like:

> “A calm train ride where you can finally focus.”

---

If something is unclear:

* Prefer simplicity
* Avoid overdesign
* Focus on clarity and calmness
